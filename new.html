      <div class="first-text">Happy 2 month gianna.</div>
      <div class="second-text">
        Ever since the day i met you there was something i knew deep down telling me that you are who i always needed, and never have i ever been so happy about my gut feeling because meeting you, expirenceing you, and being with you made me happier than i ever thought possible.
      </div>
      <div class="third-text">I Love you. In a way that can never be described, in a way that words cant begin to comprehend, and in a way where it makes me want to expload. You might not get it but every action, ever text, ever geasture comes from so deep withing my soul. You have never stopped making me feel like the most important person in the whole wide universe and i want you to feel the same when i talk to you.</div>
      <div class="fourth-text">
        I love you like the sun loves the earth, i love you like a flower loves a bee, i love you like a 2000s romance drama, like a smokey window night in a car, or like a painter loves his creation, My love looks like a feild of tulips with the setting sun over head, My love looks like gianna cantore, walking down that asile in a white dress walking to the alter where i stand, where i have finally cry after years, where i stand there and suddenly all the days where we might have fought or tried a little less, and all the days where i worried and you were there, all the nights where i hated myself but you showed me the love inside me, all the times where i hugged you and felt like everything will be alright. That is what my love looks like.
      </div>
      <div class="fifth-text">
        I have flaws, problems. I overthink, i am clingy, i hate when i am not the only one who gets your attention, i dont like when other guys talk to you, i hate when you tell me about things that you didnt like, and i hate when your busy, tired, or in a mood, when you arent super duper loving, but even though i have all these flaws, one day i am super narcessistcc and the next i am a sad sack, all these problems i have one person that makes me love even these. That special person is you gianna, i love you so much. 


                                  So will you do me the greatest honor there is and not just make me the happiest bf anymore but the happiest man every day, and let death do us part

                                                                                          will you marry me gianna cantore?
